Most of the files are '.m' files that are ready to be run by MATLAB.  Just make
sure that this directory is in the MATLAB path.

the "model3d" and "serialize" functions are MATLAB mex functions that must be
compiled.  Binaries are included for Windows and Linux, compiled with MATLAB
14, service pack 2.  The Linux compiler is gcc version 3.2.3.  The Windows
compiler is Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1.

The binary mex files can be recompiled from the src directory.  Included are a 
Makefile that works on Linux systems and can be re-configured easily for
different unix-like systems.  Also included are the Visual Studio Solution
object that can be loaded into the Visual C++ compiler.
