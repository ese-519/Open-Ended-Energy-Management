## deploying MATLAB applications

- [MATLAB compiler](http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/) lets you share MATLAB programs as standalone applications
- All applications created with MATLAB Compiler use the [MATLAB Runtime](http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/), which enables royalty-free deployment to users who do not need MATLAB. You can package the runtime with the application, or have your users download it during installation.
