### DESCRIPTION AND GOALS
Our project aims to use Amazon Alexa as a platform for a more interactive and open-ended energy management system. Users will be able to verbally pose questions, which the system will categorize, request additional information if needed, and synthesize queries over trained machine learning data structures to generate a response. The verbal response will be supplemented with procedurally-generated graphics that help the user visualize different comparisons. 

#### Baseline Goals
1. Send requests from Alexa app on Amazon Echo to backend processing 
2. Update GUI based on query results with an appropriate graphical output in the user's browser
3. Respond to user’s question from Alexa with an appropriate verbal output from the Echo speaker

#### Reach Goals
1. Identify the category for a user’s question
2. Send response to user if additional information is needed to complete query
3. Procedurally generate graphical output based on the category of the user’s question

### BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

#### Alexa Skill
The Energy Advisor Alexa skill can be configured in the Amazon developer portal

1. Log in to the [Amazon developer portal](https://developer.amazon.com/)
2. In the top menu, select "ALEXA"
3. On the "Get started with Alexa" page, select "Alexa Skills Kit"
4. On the "Building Alexa Skills with the Alexa Skills Kit" page, select "Add a New Skill"
5. Complete the Skill Information section with the information from [alexa-skill/skill_info.txt](alexa-skill/skill_info.txt)
6. Complete the Interaction Model section with the information from [alexa-skill/interaction-model](alexa-skill/interaction-model)
7. In the Configuration, add the ARN of the AWS Lambda function created in the next section in the Endpoint field

#### AWS Lambda Function
The AWS Lambda function used to process requests generated by the Alexa skill can be configured in the [AWS console](https://aws.amazon.com/)

1. Install the [awscli tools](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/?sc_channel=PS&sc_campaign=acquisition_US&sc_publisher=google&sc_medium=command_line_b&sc_content=aws_cli_bmm&sc_detail=%2Baws%20%2Bcli&sc_category=command_line&sc_segment=159752350301&sc_matchtype=b&sc_country=US&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!159752350301!b!!g!!%2Baws%20%2Bcli&ef_id=WEjP8gAAACGg3q8g:20161208031354:s)
2. In a terminal, run `aws configure`. Enter credentials and use region 'us-east-1'
3. Navigate to the [aws](aws) directory
4. Run `create-lambda-role.sh`
5. Copy the returned ARN for the role into [aws/deploy-lambda.sh](aws/deploy-lambda.sh)
6. Copy the Alexa skill ID from the Amazon developer portal, and the IP address of the web server into the Lambda function
6. Run `deploy-lambda.sh`
7. In the AWS console, navigate to the Lambda service. Add an Alexa Skills kit trigger.
