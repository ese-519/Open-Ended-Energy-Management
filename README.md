### DESCRIPTION AND GOALS
Our project aims to use Amazon Alexa as a platform for a more interactive and open-ended energy management system. Users will be able to verbally pose questions, which the system will categorize, request additional information if needed, and synthesize queries over trained machine learning data structures to generate a response. The verbal response will be supplemented with procedurally-generated graphics that help the user visualize different comparisons. 

#### Baseline Goals
1. Send requests from Alexa app on Amazon Echo to backend processing 
2. Update GUI based on query results with an appropriate graphical output in the user's browser
3. Respond to user’s question from Alexa with an appropriate verbal output from the Echo speaker

#### Reach Goals
1. Identify the category for a user’s question
2. Send response to user if additional information is needed to complete query
3. Procedurally generate graphical output based on the category of the user’s question
